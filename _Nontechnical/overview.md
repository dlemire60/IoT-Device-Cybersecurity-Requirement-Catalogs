# Non-Technical Supporting Capabilities Catalog

This catalog section presents a collection of non-technical supporting capabilities that expand on the baseline set of capabilities defined in [NISTIR 8259B, _IoT Non-Technical Supporting Capability Core Baseline_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8259b/draft).  The NISTIR defines an IoT device manufacturer's non-technical supporting capability core baseline, which is a set of non-technical supporting capabilities generally needed from manufacturers or other third parties to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organizationâ€™s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems. The baseline provides a starting point to use in identifying a set of detailed actions that implement the device non-technical support capabilities in the baseline. The four non-technical supporting capabilities are:

* **Documentation:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create, gather, and store information relevant to cybersecurity of the IoT device throughout the development of a device and its subsequent lifecycle.  

* **Information and Query Reception:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to receive from the customer information and queries related to cybersecurity of the IoT device.

* **Information Dissemination:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to broadcast and distribute information related to cybersecurity of the IoT device. 

* **Education and Awareness:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create awareness of and educate customers about cybersecurity-related information, considerations, features, etc. of the IoT device. 

This on-line catalog enumerates specific activities associated with each of the four non-technical supporting capabilities listed above. These actions were identified by applying an IoT focus to the security and privacy controls contained in NIST SP 800-53 to arrive at specific ability statements. The catalog includes a section of non-technical activities for manufacturers and their supporting third parties ([currently on-line](manufacturer_introduction.md)) and for IoT device customers (to be supplied).


As not every action listed here is applicable to every situation, this catalog should be viewed as a collection of non-technical supporting capabilities that can be filtered down to a profile suitable for a particular use case, industry sector, or customer organization, as described in [NISTIR 8259C, _Creating a Profile Using the IoT Core Baseline and Non-Technical Baseline_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8259c/draft).
