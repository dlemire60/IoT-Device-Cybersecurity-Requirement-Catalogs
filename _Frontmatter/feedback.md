# NIST Needs Your Feedback 

The Cybersecurity for IoT program requests your feedback on the material in this catalog. Please consider the following questions:

- For any given technical capability and sub-capability, have we identified the most common, or expected, device cybersecurity capability or sub-capability that should be built within an IoT device?
- Are there any common IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities or sub-capabilities that we have not included?
- Do you have any suggested updates or additions to elements of device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities, or suggestions for re-arranging the elements?
- Are there any common IoT device non-technical manufacturer supporting capabilities that we have not included?
- Do you have any suggested updates or additions to the non-technical supporting capabilities?
- Do you find it useful to have the technical capabilities catalog separate from the non-technical capabilities? Why or why not?
- Is this structure (i.e., capability->sub-capability->element) useful for defining device cybersecurity capabilities?
- Would mapping the catalog elements to NISTIR 8259A, NISTIR 8259B, NIST SP 800-53 rev 5, and/or the Cybersecurity Framework be helpful?

# Providing Feedback

NIST encourages the use of GitHub mechanisms to provide feedback on our catalog contents.  Interested parties can share feedback and ask questions about resources in the [catalog repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/IoT-Device-Cybersecurity-Requirement-Catalogs/) using the [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) feature. Specific change proposals can be contributed using the [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) feature. 

If you’d like to submit feedback the traditional way, please send us feedback to our mailbox at IoTsecurity@nist.gov.
